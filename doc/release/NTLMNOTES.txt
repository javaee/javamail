	Notes for use of NTLM authentication support with JavaMail
	----------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to the efforts of Luís Serralheiro, JavaMail now suports the use
of Microsoft's proprietary NTLM authentication mechanism.  This support
within JavaMail builds on the base NTLM support provided by the JCIFS
project.  To use this NTLM support in JavaMail, you'll also need to
include the jcifs jar file in your CLASSPATH.  You can download the
latest jcifs jar file from the JCIFS site: http://jcifs.samba.org
JCIFS is available under the LGPL license.

This release of JavaMail was tested with the 1.3.12 version of JCIFS
and Microsoft Exchange 5.5 and 2007.  Note that the 1.2.x versions of
JCIFS won't work as the API has changed incompatibly.

The SMTP and IMAP providers support the use of NTLM authentication.
The following properties can be used to configure the NTLM support:

mail.<protocol>.auth.ntlm.domain
	The NTLM authentication domain.

mail.<protocol>.auth.ntlm.flags
	NTLM protocol-specific flags.
	See http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/ntlm.html#theNtlmFlags for details.


NOTE:	This capability is very new and has NOT been thoroughly tested.
	Please send any feedback or bug reports to us at javamail@sun.com.

WARNING: This support, and the APIs and properties used to control it,
should be considered EXPERIMENTAL.  They may be changed in the future
in ways that are incompatible with applications using the current APIs
and properties.
