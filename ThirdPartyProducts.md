* exJello is a JavaMail provider that connects to a Microsoft Exchange
  server (actually, it uses the WebDAV interface exposed by Outlook Web
  Access).  It is designed as a drop-in replacement for the standard
  POP3 and SMTP providers.  This allows you to send and receive messages
  through your Exchange server in situations where a POP3/SMTP interface
  is not available (through a restrictive firewall, for example, or if
  your administrator simply does not provide a POP3 or SMTP gateway).

* Apache POI - the Java API for Microsoft Documents.
  The Apache POI Project's mission is to create and maintain Java
  APIs for manipulating various file formats based upon the Office
  Open XML standards (OOXML) and Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document
  format (OLE2). In short, you can read and write MS Excel files
  using Java. In addition, you can read and write MS Word and MS
  PowerPoint files using Java.  The project has recently added
  support for Outlook (HSMF), which allows reading Outlook MSG
  files.  At this time, it provides simple read access to some of the
  textual content of MSG files.

  same way it would do with POP3 or IMAP remote mail.  At the moment
  jmbox supports navigation and reading from Outlook Express 5/6 mail
  (dbx format).  Writing into folders and support for other
  repositories (mbox) will be added.  Available at:

* A sample application using the Devsphere Mapping Framework:
  A servlet called FormMailer converts data collected with HTML 
  forms to objects and then to key-value pairs. The obtained ASCII 
  text is mailed to one or more addresses using JavaMail.

  the messages from the mail server. Then, it converts the obtained 
  key-value pairs to objects, which are forwarded to a dynamically 
  loaded class for processing.  The application is described in
  Chapters 12-17 of the Developer's Guide, available at
