Support for creating and parsing Delivery Status Notifications.
Refer to <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3462.txt" TARGET="_top">
RFC 3462</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3464.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 3464</A>
for more information.
</P>
<P>
A Delivery Status Notification is a MIME message with a Content-Type
of <code>multipart/report</code>.
A {@link com.sun.mail.dsn.MultipartReport MultipartReport} object
represents the content of such a message.
The MultipartReport object contains several parts that represent the
information in a delivery status notification.
The first part is usually a <code>text/plain</code> part that
describes the reason for the notification.
The second part is a <code>message/delivery-status</code> part,
which is represented by a
{@link com.sun.mail.dsn.DeliveryStatus DeliveryStatus} object, and contains
details about the notification.
The third part is either an entire copy of the original message
that is returned, represented by a
{@link javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage MimeMessage} object, or
just the headers of the original message, represented by a
{@link com.sun.mail.dsn.MessageHeaders MessageHeaders} object.
