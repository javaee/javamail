Comment:

        A set of test headers to test parameter list parsing and
	especially RFC 2231 decoding.
        Use with "paramtest -p <paramdata".

	All tests assume "mail.mime.decodeparameters" is set to "true",
	which is done at the start of paramtest.

        CAREFUL: a blank line in this file causes everything following it
                 to be ignored until a line starting with "From " (so that
                 paramtest -p can be pointed at a real mailbox).

From start here
Comment:
	This set of headers are all good and test RFC 2231 decoding.

	These headers test error cases that don't generate parse exceptions.

Comment:
	This is an error case with no right answer.
	Should we assume earlier segments are missing and just decode
	this segment?  Or should we assume that the "*3" is part of
	the parameter name and this is a single segment encoded parameter?
	Currently we do the former.
