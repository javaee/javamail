Comment:
	.
	A set of test addresses stolen from the dtmail test suite,
	with a few of my own.
	Use with "addrtest -p <addrlist".
	.
	CAREFUL: a blank line in this file causes everything following it
		 to be ignored until a line starting with "From " (so that
		 addrtest -p can be pointed at a real mailbox).
Comment:
	This first set of addresses are all good.
